# Modelling Spatial Heterogeneity in Singapore's HDB Resale Market: A comparative Analysis of OLS and Euclidean Distance-Based GWR

This repository contains the full analytical workflow, data-processing scripts, and modelling code for this project.
This project investigates spatial variations in housing price determinants across Singapore's public housing (HDB) market using a combination of **global** and **local** spatial regression techniques.

📌**Project Overview**
Housing prices in Singapore exhibit pronounced spatial variation driven by accessibility, amenities, built-environment characteristics, and neighbourhood differences. Traditional global regression models (e.g., OLS) assume spatial stationarity, which often fails in a highly differentiated urban landscape like Singapore.

This project develops a comparative framework:
- **Global OLS hedonic modelling**
- **Local Euclidean Distance-based Geographically Weighted Regression (ED-based GWR)**(adaptive kernel, nearest-neighbour bandwidths)
